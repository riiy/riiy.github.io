# 远程工作需要避免的七个错误

我们固执地相信，远程工作为软件开发者平衡个人成长与自由提供了极好的机会。但远程工作并不是简单投个简历就能获得的，每个月有成千上万的开发者申请远程工作的空缺职位，在这些申请中有大量的共同错误导致他们没有获得面试邀请。想要得到远程工作机会需要避免本文提到的这些错误，如果你理解并规避了这些错误，就能大大提高找到满意的远程工作机会。

## 没有专门制定简历和申请信

排第一位的问题是远程开发者没有根据所要申请职位制定他们的简历，他们提供的是统一的简历和求职信。这对训练有素的招聘者来说，这透露出他们的懒惰和不专业。申请一个远程职位，你必须表现出你研究过你所申请的公司，你理解他们的文化，价值观和需求。所以定制你的申请信，强调相关的工作经验和技巧（这对算法系统来说很重要），展示对企业需求的兴趣。当然，专门定制每一次申请意味着更多的工作量，但这是能得到真正机遇唯一的方法，特别是在充满竞争的全球市场更是如此。

## 看重软件技术，过于忽略软技能

对于开发者来说，技术固然重要，但我们发现拥有最好的软技能的开发者更容易胜出。这些技能包括：流利交流、时间管理、自律和问题解决能力。
Candidates who fail to highlight these skills in their applications or interviews are at a serious disadvantage compared to those who do. Our clients, and remote employers in general, look for candidates who can express themselves effectively and collaborate well in a distributed team. 

So provide examples of how you've managed your time efficiently, how you've solved problems independently, how you set priorities, et cetera. They are indicators of your ability to thrive in a remote environment.

## 没有强调远程工作经验
If you've worked remotely before, please emphasize it. You may as well, given that you're applying for a remote job. And this doesn't necessarily have to be full-time remote experience. If you've worked remotely as a freelancer, on a remote project, or even on open-source code (remote by its very nature), it demonstrates the self-discipline and adaptability companies are looking for in their remote hires.

In your resume and cover letter, be sure to mention specific remote projects or roles. Detail the skills and tools you used to succeed. Discuss the remote challeng-es you overcame. Explain that you know how to use remote work tools like Slack, Trello, Zoom, Discord. Trust us, familiarity with these tools is not always a given.

## 忽视自己的在线状态
Hiring managers google you. That's just the world we live in today and, from their perspective, it makes sense too. You're free to post whatever you want on social media, but companies are equally free to look at your profiles and decide if it would be better not to hire you based on your "hot takes" and "unpopular opinions." 

 It swings the other way too. If you have an up-to-date LinkedIn profile, an active GitHub, and a good-looking portfolio website, hiring managers will be much more inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt and invite you for an interview. Candidates with a consistent and professional online presence are much beloved by companies looking to hire remotely.
 
## 没有准备在线面试
Another surprisingly common mistake if you want to get hired remotely is not preparing properly for online interviews. You've been invited to an interview, which is genuinely the the biggest hurdle. Don't botch it now because you didn't test your equipment beforehand or look as if you've just stepped out of bed.

Ensure that your camera, microphone, and internet connection are working smoothly. Choose a quiet, well-lit space for the interview, free from distractions and background noise. Rehearse answers for the questions you're most likely to get, and demonstrate confidence and professionalism during the interview. Get these things right and you will leave a positive impression during the interview.

## 没有表现出文化契合度
Cultural fit is important when hiring remotely. Many candidates neglect to show how they align with the company's values and culture. Sometimes, they're not even aware of the company's values. You could be the most technically competent developer in the world, but if you're not a good cultural fit, it'll be a hard pass for experienced hiring managers.

During the interview, express your enthusiasm for the company's mission and culture. Share stories or examples that demonstrate your adaptability and ability to thrive in diverse environments. Employers are more likely to hire candidates who they believe will integrate well with the existing team and contribute positively to the company's culture.

## 没有有效的人脉网络
Applying for remote jobs is obviously a crucial aspect of getting a remote job, but many developers underestimate the power of networking. A huge amount of roles are filled before they're even advertised, and they're filled because someone knows someone else who they know would be a good fit. 

To network effectively as a remote developer, engage with online communities, attend virtual events, and connect with professionals on LinkedIn. Participate in industry discussions and contribute valuable insights to demonstrate your expertise and passion for your field. Networking is not just about seeking job opportunities; it's about building meaningful relationships that can support your career growth and development over time.
